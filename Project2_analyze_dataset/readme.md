This folder contains the second of six projects related to the Udacity Nano degree program in Data analytics.

In this project Udacity provided a dataset containing data on the user conversions related to a new web page design. This data is available in this folder.
The goal of the project is to provide an advise on the adoption of the new page design using several statistical analysis. 
In this project I used pandas and numpy for descriptive statistics, A/B testing, logistical regression modelling and multi logistical regression modelling.
Matplotlib is used to provide visuals. 

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook, containing the code. An HTML version of the jupyter notebook, the used data and the project review.
